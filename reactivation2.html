<!-- *******IT'S ALL ABOUT COMPONENTS, STATES AND PROPS, and remember that a render can only essentially display 1 parent element, if we want to render multiple parent elements, they have to be wrapped in a div. Remember to use ".bind(this)" when passing functions or methods around. Whenever we're binding a value, we'll also set up a change listener for that, so that it actually changes when the value changes.*******
***Excerpt of advice from YouTube: The easiest way to set up your project is to make a directory tree structure the way it's displayed on his sublime text editor.  If you can't make out the structure, do this:  create your project folder; inside the project folder create a 'src' folder; inside the 'src' folder, create a 'js' folder.  You will now create four files.  Create two empty files,  'package.json' and a 'webpack.config.js', and place them at the top level of your project folder.  Create another empty file, 'index.html' and put it inside your 'src' folder.   Create the last file, 'client.js' and place it inside 'js' folder.

Now advance the video to 3:04 and simply type what you see into your 'client.js' file.  As for the contents of the other three files, you can go to the github repository he listed in the  comments under the video.  Specifically, you will need to access the '1-basic-react' folder to get the contents of each the other three files.  

After you have set up your folders and copied the files, you run 'npm install', then 'webpack',  and the rest of the folders and files will be automatically installed.  At this point you can advance to '2:38' in  the video and continue following along.  Hope this helps you and anyone else who might have the same question.﻿***-->

<!-- time to continue to #6 REACT ROUTER & INTRO TO SINGLE PAGE APPS WITH REACTJS-->
<!-- So basically a single page application is being able to navigate, do everything you normally do, without ever leaving the page. It all happens within JavaScript, notifications and alerts pop up in real-time, you don't have to navigate away.-->
<!--***Actually, quick note, I have maintained some of the original code on files with the name Original next to them, just in case. This is because the starting code from #6 onwards are not quite the same as where the tutorial left off. This is thanks to one of the user comments on #6 YouTube with the name of Victor Catalin Torac and the github user name of where it's from is Spartano.***-->
<!-- So let's go ahead and get into how we're going to do this. Again, the client.js, just like last time is loading in Layout as in "import Layout from './components/Layout'", but this time it's "import Layout from "./pages/Layout", it's finding "id=app" by doing "const app = document.getElementById("app")", and it's rendering our Layout into that id. So nothing magical going on. The first thing we want to setup is Routing. SO that's where when we click on buttons, we can actually route to different pages, different states of the application, without ever actually leaving the HTML page, it all happens in the JavaScript. For React, we're going to want to use "react-router", so we're going to want to "npm install -S react-router" on the terminal console. And then we also want to add history for html 5 history we'll install that too, but history has version 2.0 but that's only supported with react-router2.0 which is not out yet, so we'll stick to installing history at version 1 so we'll type "npm install -S history@1" and we think it'll grab history at 1.17, and it did grab history at 1.17. So those are added to our package.json **quick note: I just realized when I installed react-router that it did take version 2.0, in fact, it took 2.7.0, instead of 1.0.3 as in the video, so version 2.0 is out now as of this time.** and then we'll just hit "npm install" for the rest. And as one of the awesome tutorial viewer pointed out, whenever we're running a script in npm, it automatically adds "./node_modules/.bin/" to the path, as in"./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot" so we don't actually have to do this part, we could just run webpack-dev-server as in "webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot" and if that file, webpack-dev-server, exists in bin, which it does, we can just execute it as a command, as long as we're doing it from node script, it's going to work great. And we're installed, we're good to go, we just run "npm run dev", and we're rocking and rolling. Killer News.net is the only thing that's actually dynamic on our page right now, that is our Layout component, everything else here is static HTML, so as we go, we're going to be converting this all over to dynamic. Let's just go ahead and start with our routes. Our routes are, as we click, the "#" part of our navigation will change, and allow us to go to to different pages and different states of our application. So react-router is installed, so we can now import it here, in client.js as in "import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, hashHistory} from 'react-router';" the hashHistory gets the HTML5 history booted up. And this is all on react-router's github page, so this is nothing magical here. And then, instead of rendering a <Layout/> in client.js like "ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);" we're simply going to render a router, as in "ReactDOM.render(<Router></Router>, app);" . So we've got our router rendered, and we're going to have our history booted up here, as in "ReactDOM.render(<Router history={hashHistory}></Router>, app);"  So there we go, that's all it really takes to get react router going. And then we can render out all our routes and point them to different components. So our basic route is going to be our Layout, and that's got a path of route, and the component for that is Layout, as in "<Route path="/" component={Layout}></Route>" in "ReactDOM.render(<Router history={hashHistory}><Route path="/" component={Layout}></Route></Router>, app);" so we've already imported Layout, and we can inject Layout there, so that's how that's working, and then we can close out that route. So now our app should still be working. Let's make sure it goes, bundle is valid, it's reloading, and Killer News.net is still rendering. So that's our Layout, rendering here for the default path, which is this forward slash, '/', in "<Route path="/" component={Layout}></Route>". So now we can add some sub routes to this, kind of how our React layout will work is our Layout's going to be whatever's on our entire page. So that's going to be our navigation up there, our footer down there, and all the other child routes will get loaded here, depending on which page we're on, which state we're on. And that Layout might even load in several different components, like it will load in a navigation component, it will load in a footer component, for now, we just have Killer News.net. So let's go and just show how to make our first few routes and then we'll start breaking this page out in the next video. So let's go ahead and make an index route, well let's make our components here first, so notice we actually created a pages folder and we put Layout in there, so kind of those top level pages, kind of what we're considering Featured, Archives, Settings, we're gonna put all those in a pages folder just so it's a little easier to get to them. So we're going to save these as Featured, we're going to go ahead and just hack these now as in creating a Featured.js file, copying the code from Layout.js into it, and then just hacking it and changing it from Layout to Featured, as in "export default class Layout extends React.Component..." to "export default class Featured extends React.Component..." and also changing the h1 tag contents from "Killer News.net" to "Featured". Then we do the same with Archives and Settings. Okay, so we have "Features", "Archives", and "Settings" and let's go ahead and import those now into client.js as in "import Featured from "./pages/Featured"; and so on and so forth. We got them all in, they're not in alphabetical order, but we're OCD so we have to do it haha. And then let's go ahead and load our index route as in "<IndexRoute component={Featured}></IndexRoute>" it's the same path as "/" because it's our default, we don't need to put in "/", as in "<IndexRoute component={Featured}></IndexRoute>" because it's obviously our index route, its component gets Featured. And now we can actually add some other routes here, and they'll have different path, so this path will be archives as in "path='archives'" and that'll get the archives component as "{Archives}" as in"<Route path="archives" component={Archives}></Route>" and do the same one more time for Settings as in "<Route path="settings" component={Settings}></Route>". Excellent, so now, we should actually be able to route back and forth. So now we can actually get to those, let's go to our Layout.js and build a navigation here. So we've got Killer(?) News.net, let's wrap this in a div, let's go ahead and make our first button. What we're going to do is we're going to import link from react-router as in "import { Link } from 'react-router'; " and that's going to allow us to do just a link, so instead of doing an "a" tag with an "href" in it, we're actually just going to do a Link tag with a to in it, and now all we have to do is give it a place that we're going to, so all we have to do is add "to=archives" in it as in "<Link to="archives">archives</Link>" so when clicking on this link, we should notice the url path on the browser bar to show /archives. It's going to load Archives, it's going to grab that component, and it's going to inject that Component, Archives, as a child Component to Layout. So it's basically going to send "this.props.children" and it's going to be this guy right here "<Link to="archives">archives</Link>", so now, all we have to do, is render out {this.props.children}, wherever we want it to be. In this case, right above "<Link to="archives">archives</Link>". So what react-router has done again, is it's taking whatever we've given it as children, which in this case it's going to match - hey, you're a child, you match, we're correctly on this path, you match as a valid child, we're going to ahead and inject you as this.props.children, and now we can spit that out wherever in Layout we want it to appear - there we go, archives is there. So on and so forth with settings. There we go, it dynamically happened. And you notice that the hash navigation is also changing on the browser url bar. There are some other ways we could do this as well instead of just links, we could also wrap, say, if we wanted to do a button, we could just wrap our button tags within the link as in "<Link to="settings"><button>settings</button></Link>", we can even make it a bootstrap button as in "<Link to="settings"><button class="btn btn-primary">settings</button></Link>". Another thing we can do, is sort of call this programmatically, we can just do a button here as in "<button onClick={this.navigate.bind(this)}>featured</button>" and then do " navigate(){console.log(this.props);}" and "console.log(this.props);" so we can see what react-router injects into those props for us when we inspect. So when we hit featured, here's our props that we're getting, we're getting a props children, which is a react component, we're also getting a history option, we're getting this history thing, we're getting a route, which is the path that we're on, we're getting a route params, and so it navigates right there, we're getting a lot of stuff, the prop that we're looking for is history, and we can simply push a state, and we're going to go to just our route,  as in "this.props.history.pushState(null, "/");" and now the featured button will push state and it will take us back home. * Just a note: there are several notes on the console stating some of the syntax is deprecated as in "browser.js:49 Warning: [react-router] `props.history` and `context.history` are deprecated. Please use `context.router`.", and also "browser.js:49 Warning: [history] pushState is deprecated; use push instead", just as a sidenote to keep in mind*. There we go, it pushed us back home, and we're on featured,- archives, settings, featured. Another thing we can do, now, whenever we pushState, we get the back button. Our back button takes us to settings. If we notice right there, pushState, back buttons takes us to settings. We can also replace state, as in"this.props.history.replaceState(null, "/"); " and now we won't get the back button on the browser, it'll just say hey- our state's just going to just switch out right away, we're there, we're gonna hit featured, if we hit the back button, we stay right where we are, because that was where we started off. So replaceState is very different from pushState, very important for us to know. * As a sidenote, another note on the console showed stating: "browser.js:49 Warning: [history] replaceState is deprecated; use replace instead" , just as a sidenote to keep in mind.* And that's our basic navigation.
