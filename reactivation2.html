<!-- *******IT'S ALL ABOUT COMPONENTS, STATES AND PROPS, and remember that a render can only essentially display 1 parent element, if we want to render multiple parent elements, they have to be wrapped in a div. Remember to use ".bind(this)" when passing functions or methods around. Whenever we're binding a value, we'll also set up a change listener for that, so that it actually changes when the value changes.*******
***Excerpt of advice from YouTube: The easiest way to set up your project is to make a directory tree structure the way it's displayed on his sublime text editor.  If you can't make out the structure, do this:  create your project folder; inside the project folder create a 'src' folder; inside the 'src' folder, create a 'js' folder.  You will now create four files.  Create two empty files,  'package.json' and a 'webpack.config.js', and place them at the top level of your project folder.  Create another empty file, 'index.html' and put it inside your 'src' folder.   Create the last file, 'client.js' and place it inside 'js' folder.

Now advance the video to 3:04 and simply type what you see into your 'client.js' file.  As for the contents of the other three files, you can go to the github repository he listed in the  comments under the video.  Specifically, you will need to access the '1-basic-react' folder to get the contents of each the other three files.  

After you have set up your folders and copied the files, you run 'npm install', then 'webpack',  and the rest of the folders and files will be automatically installed.  At this point you can advance to '2:38' in  the video and continue following along.  Hope this helps you and anyone else who might have the same question.ï»¿***-->

the contents from package.json are from https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials/blob/master/1-basic-react/package.json, the only thing I changed was the name, to "reactivation", for my own work, but in this case, now it's reactivation2-->
<!-- before, when i ran "npm install", then "webpack", it said "bash webpack command not found" I realized that I had to first "npm install webpack" first, and then run "webpack" and this seemed to work-->

<!-- time to continue to #6 REACT ROUTER & INTRO TO SINGLE PAGE APPS WITH REACTJS-->
<!-- So basically a single page application is being able to navigate, do everything you normally do, without ever leaving the page. It all happens within JavaScript, notifications and alerts pop up in real-time, you don't have to navigate away.-->
<!--***Actually, quick note, I have maintained some of the original code on files with the name Original next to them, just in case. This is because the starting code from #6 onwards are not quite the same as where the tutorial left off. This is thanks to one of the user comments on #6 YouTube with the name of Victor Catalin Torac and the github user name of where it's from is Spartano.***-->
<!-- So let's go ahead and get into how we're going to do this. Again, the client.js, just like last time is loading in Layout as in "import Layout from './components/Layout'", but this time it's "import Layout from "./pages/Layout", it's finding "id=app" by doing "const app = document.getElementById("app")", and it's rendering our Layout into that id. So nothing magical going on. The first thing we want to setup is Routing. SO that's where when we click on buttons, we can actually route to different pages, different states of the application, without ever actually leaving the HTML page, it all happens in the JavaScript. For React, we're going to want to use "react-router", so we're going to want to "npm install -S react-router" on the terminal console. And then we also want to add history for html 5 history we'll install that too, but history has version 2.0 but that's only supported with react-router2.0 which is not out yet, so we'll stick to installing history at version 1 so we'll type "npm install -S history@1" and we think it'll grab history at 1.17, and it did grab history at 1.17. So those are added to our package.json **quick note: I just realized when I installed react-router that it did take version 2.0, in fact, it took 2.7.0, instead of 1.0.3 as in the video, so version 2.0 is out now as of this time.** and then we'll just hit "npm install" for the rest. And as one of the awesome tutorial viewer pointed out, whenever we're running a script in npm, it automatically adds "./node_modules/.bin/" to the path, as in"./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot" so we don't actually have to do this part, we could just run webpack-dev-server as in "webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot" and if that file, webpack-dev-server, exists in bin, which it does, we can just execute it as a command, as long as we're doing it from node script, it's going to work great. And we're installed, we're good to go, we just run "npm run dev", and we're rocking and rolling. Killer News.net is the only thing that's actually dynamic on our page right now, that is our Layout component, everything else here is static HTML, so as we go, we're going to be converting this all over to dynamic. Let's just go ahead and start with our routes. Our routes are, as we click, the "#" part of our navigation will change, and allow us to go to to different pages and different states of our application. So react-router is installed, so we can now import it here, in client.js as in "import { Router, Route, IndexRoute, hashHistory} from 'react-router';" the hashHistory gets the HTML5 history booted up. And this is all on react-router's github page, so this is nothing magical here. And then, instead of rendering a <Layout/> in client.js like "ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);" we're simply going to render a router, as in "ReactDOM.render(<Router></Router>, app);" . So we've got our router rendered, and we're going to have our history booted up here, as in "ReactDOM.render(<Router history={hashHistory}></Router>, app);"  So there we go, that's all it really takes to get react router going. And then we can render out all our routes and point them to different components. So our basic route is going to be our Layout, and that's got a path of route, and the component for that is Layout, as in "<Route path="/" component={Layout}></Route>" in "ReactDOM.render(<Router history={hashHistory}><Route path="/" component={Layout}></Route></Router>, app);" so we've already imported Layout, and we can inject Layout there, so that's how that's working, and then we can close out that route. So now our app should still be working. Let's make sure it goes, it's valid, it's reloading, and Killer News.net is still rendering. So that's our Layout.   LEFT OFF AT #6 AT AROUND 5:27
